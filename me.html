<h1><u>Mechanical Engineering</u></h1>
     <p>Established in the year 2003, the Department of Mechanical Engineering at GGITS has developed from an undergraduate program with an intake of 60 students 
to one of the marquee programs in the Institute with over 500 students pursuing 4-year B.Tech and 2-year M.Tech (with specializations in Advanced Production 
System and Machine Design) programs. The Mechanical Engineering programs (UG) have been accredited by the NBA, awarded for 3 years w.e.f.July 2018. 
The Mechanical Engineering department has also steadily progressed financially with the funds acquired for research growing every year.<br>



<li>The research in the Department is concentrated mostly in three thrust areas namely Design of machine components, CFD and Metal cutting, 
while Supply Chain Management, Material science and Tribology have also evolved into areas of research. The faculty of the Department 
closely interacts with the industry in keeping up with the latest trends in research and development as well as the training of the 
students and development of curriculum in accordance with the global trends. The department offers its faculty several facilities for initiating 
and sustaining research activities by providing access to the latest books, journals, software and equipment required. The curriculum of the department 
academic programs is being subjected to continuous assessment by keeping in view the latest trends and developments around the world.<br>

Further, students are encouraged to organize/participate in technical fests and other academic activities in accordance with SAE India, 
guidelines to develop leadership skills. Though most of the graduating students get offers from the leading industries in India/abroad, 
the department of Mechanical Engineering strongly recommends the continuation of education and the development of research skills of the individuals. 
As such, a significant number of GGITS Mechanical Engineering Alumni are scattered across various Universities around the world as students/faculty and 
also occupy substantial positions in various organizations/industries globally. At present, over 500 undergraduate and 36 graduate students are enrolled 
in various programs offered by the department. The undergraduate curriculum requires mandatory completion of all the theoretical and laboratory courses offered 
by the department irrespective of the area of specialization. In addition to academics and research, the department focuses on guiding the students 
towards discipline and responsibility, thus aiding in the development of model citizens for the society.</li></p><br>
